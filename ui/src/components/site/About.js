        There are so many options to find icons, but nary an option to create one easily. Some require you to mention their name
        (License), and many don&apos;t. If you want to commercialize your usage, you need to pay. Now you get a brilliant idea to
        create one on your own and begin the game of research. Then you will fall into a bottomless pit of options.

        <span className="title">SVGry</span> is an idea brewed over coffee with a friend to provide the easiest way to create SVGs
        or icons. Algorithms can pick up different regions of a line drawing. But they are ineffective and cannot do all the job
        to make an SVG. SVGry provides a pretty decent close approximation and a swarm of tools to take you through the rest of
        the way.
